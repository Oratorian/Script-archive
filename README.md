This is my small Script Repository with scripts I once created.

They will get updates if needed.


| Script File | Information |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Bash/auth-backup | Was used to automaticly restore google authenticator file0 for 2FA SSH-server logins, whenever the user deleted them. |
| Bash/backup.sh | Simple Backupscript using rsync |
| Bash/fivemupdate.sh | Automaticly retrieves the latest fxserver artifacts unpacks and install them. |
| Batch/Windows Activation (c) by Andrew(v1.0).bat | A Batch based KMS Windows/Office Activator (not maintained anymore). |
| Batch/passwd.bat | A simple password generator. |
| Powershell/fivemupdate.ps1 | The Windows equivalent to fivemupdate.sh. |
